Type,Label ID,Pathology,Definition
Local,0,Aortic enlargement,An abnormal bulge that occurs in the wall of the major blood vessel.
Local,1,Atelectasis,Collapse of a part of the lung due to a decrease in the amount of air in the alveoli resulting in volume loss and increased density.
Local,3,Cardiomegaly,"Enlargement of the heart, occurs when the heart of an adult patient is larger than normal and the cardiothoracic ratio is greater than 0.5."
Local,2,Calcification,Deposition of calcium salts in the lung.
Local,,Clavicle fracture,A break in the collarbone.
Local,4,Consolidation,"Any pathologic process that fills the alveoli with fluid, pus, blood, cells (including tumor cells) or other substances resulting in lobar, diffuse or multifocal ill-defined opacities."
Local,,Edema,Fluid accumulation in the tissur and air space of the lungs.
Local,,Emphysema,A condition of the lung characterized by an abnormal increase in the size of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles.
Local,,Enlarged PA,Dilatation of the pulmonary artery - a defect characterized by a wider than normal main pulmonary artery.
Local,5,Interstitial lung disease (ILD),Involvement of the supporting tissue of the lung parenchyma resulting in fine or coarse reticular opacities or small nodules.
Local,6,Infiltration,"An abnormal substance that accumulates gradually within cells or body tissues or any substance or type of cell that occurs within or spreads as through the interstices (interstitium and/or alveoli) of the lung, that is foreign to the lung, or that accumulates in greater than normal quantity within it."
Local,,Lung cavity,"Thick-walled abnormal gas-filled spaces within the lung. They are usually associated with a nodule, mass, or area of consolidation. A fluid level within the space may be present."
Local,,Lung cyst,"Lung cysts refer to round, thin-walled, low attenuation spaces/lucencies in the lung."
Local,7,Lung opacity,"Any abnormal focal or generalized opacity or opacities in lung fields (blanket tag including but not limited to consolidation, cavity, fibrosis, nodule, mass, calcification, interstitial thickening, etc.)."
Local,,Mediastinal shift,The deviation of the mediastinal structures towards one side of the chest cavity.
Local,8,Nodule/Mass,Any space occupying lesion either solitary or multiple.
Local,13,Pulmonary fibrosis,An excess of fibrotic tissue in the lung.
Local,12,Pneumothorax,The presence of gas (air) in the pleural space.
Local,11,Pleural thickening,Any form of thickening involving either the parietal or visceral pleura.
Local,10,Pleural effusion,Abnormal accumulations of fluid within the pleural space.
Local,,Rib fracture,A common injury that occurs when one of the bones in your rib cage breaks or cracks.
Local,9,Other lesion,Other lesions that are not on the list of findings or abnormalities mentioned above.
Global,,Lung tumor,"The result of abnormal rates of cell division or cell death in lung tissue, or in the airways that lead to the lungs."
Global,,Pneumonia,An infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs.
Global,,Tuberculosis,Any sign suggesting pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis.
Global,,Other diseases,Other diseases that are not on the list of diseases mentioned above.
Global,,COPD,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as a condition characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases.
Global,14,No finding,The absence of all pathologies from the chest radiograph.
